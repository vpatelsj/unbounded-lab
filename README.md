# unbounded-lab

AI showcase running on top of [unbounded-kube](https://github.com/microsoft/unbounded-kube).
See [`plan.md`](plan.md) for the sponsor-facing plan and wave structure.

## Hard rule

- The `deploy/` tree in `unbounded-kube` is for unbounded-kube *component*
  manifests (machina, net, inventory) rendered via `make *-manifests`.
- This repo is for *AI workloads* running on top of unbounded-kube.

The two never mix.

## Per-item conventions

Each `<area>/<item>/` directory contains:

- `README.md` - what it deploys, what it proves, deploy + teardown commands.
  Model license + provenance info goes in the README's intro for any item
  shipping or running model weights.
- Plain YAML manifests or a `kustomization.yaml`. Templating is allowed when reused.

## Cluster state at Wave 1 start

The `plan.md` Hardware Inventory section refers to `qwen35-35b` and `qwen36-35b`
namespaces as "currently running." On the live cluster those namespaces do not
exist; W1.1 and W1.2 are deployed greenfield directly into the new
`lab-ollama-qwen-moe` and `lab-vllm-qwen-moe` namespaces. The "grandfathering"
rule in the plan's Glossary therefore is a no-op for this cluster.

## Region A node labels

Wave 1 sets these labels on the Region A Sparks (idempotent):

```
lab.unbounded.cloud/region=a
lab.unbounded.cloud/hardware-class=dgx-spark-gb10
```

Apply via [`foundation/label-region-a.sh`](foundation/label-region-a.sh).

## Public hostname (`LAB_HOST`)

W1.1 ingresses (Ollama, Open WebUI) read their public hostname from a tiny
`configMapGenerator` in each `kustomization.yaml`. The committed defaults
are placeholders (`ollama.lab.example.com`, `chat.lab.example.com`) so the
repo carries no environment-specific names.

Override on the command line, do not commit the literal:

```sh
make LAB_HOST=mychat.example.com w1.1-up
```

The Make target backs up the Open WebUI `kustomization.yaml`, runs a sed
over the `host=` literal, applies, and restores the file (even on Ctrl-C).
If `LAB_HOST` is not set the targets print a warning and apply with the
placeholder; this is fine for local-dry-run kustomize testing but will not
produce a working public endpoint.

Only Open WebUI has a public ingress in W1.1. Ollama is cluster-internal
(W1.4 introduces the shared public-API ingress + auth proxy).
